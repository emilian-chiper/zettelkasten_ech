### Getting Started with Django
*Django* is Python’s most popular *web framework*, a set of tools designed for building interactive web applications. We’ll use it to build a project called *Learning Log*, an online journal system that lets us keep track of information you’ve learned about different topics.

We’ll write a specification for this project, and then define models for the data the app will work with. We’ll use Django’s admin system to enter some initial data, and then write views and templates so Django can build the site’s pages.
