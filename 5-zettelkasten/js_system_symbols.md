### What are they?
- There are many "system" symbols that JavaScript uses internally, and we can use them to fine-tune various aspects of our objects. Some of these:
	- `Symbol.hasInstance`
	- `Symbol.isConcatSpreadable`
	- `Symbol.iterator`
	- `Symbol.toPrimitive`
	- etc.
- See: [Well knows symbols](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-well-known-symbols) table.
